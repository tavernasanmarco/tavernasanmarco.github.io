        Our Taverna on the Go menu is as simple as it sounds; have lunch delivered or pick it up at the counter. Either way, you'll experience a convenient take on our handcrafted Italian. We serve all Taverna on the Go menu items as individual boxed lunches or platters perfect for sharing. Available for pickup or delivery only, itâ€™s a lunch menu made for the work week.
